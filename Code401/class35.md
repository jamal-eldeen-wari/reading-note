# Graph:
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of nods that call vertices potentially connected by line segments named edges.

Some Common Terminologies for Graphs:
1. Vertex: A vertex, also called a node, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
2. Edge: An edge establishes the connection between two nodes.
3. Neighbor: The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, they are connected via an edge.
4. Degree: The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

List Type of Graphs:
1. **Undirected Graphs** :It is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

2. **Directed Graphs** (Digraph): It Has a direction so eache vertex is directed at another vertex with a specific requirement of what vertex should be referenced next.


What is the differences between Complete, Connected and Disconnected ??
A: **A complete graph** is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
   **A connected graph** is graph that has all of vertices have at least one edge.
   **A disconnected graph** is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.
