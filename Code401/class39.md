# Amplify and Kinesis:
The Analytics category enables you to collect analytics data for your App. The Analytics category comes with built-in support for Amazon Pinpoint and Amazon Kinesis (Kinesis support is currently only available in the Amplify JavaScript library).

The Goal of using Analytics is to setup and configure your application with amplify

Benefits of using Analytics:
1. Real-time: Amazon Kinesis enables you to ingest, buffer, and process streaming data in real-time, so you can derive insights in seconds or minutes instead of hours or days.

2. Fully managed: Amazon Kinesis is fully managed and runs your streaming applications without requiring you to manage any infrastructure.

3. Scalable: Amazon Kinesis can handle any amount of streaming data and process data from hundreds of thousands of sources with very low latencies.
