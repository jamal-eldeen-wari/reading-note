# Functions:
JavaScript provides a way to desgin our code and make it more readable and that tool is called function. Functions is a block of code designed to perform specific task.

## Function Syntax:
We define a function by typing the keyword "function" then we give it a name (The name of the function must be meaningful) followed by argument (). Inside the argument their will be inputs for our function then after that we include the curly brackets.

**function funcName(argument){**

  **some code;**

  **return**

**}**

## Function Invocation:
The code inside the function will be executed only when the function is called. It can be called in three ways:

1. When an event occurs.

2. Automatically.

3. When it is invoked (Called from JavaScript code).

## Return Statement:
It is very important in js because it is like a stopping point when the return statement is reached the function it will stop executing.

** important to note ** that when the function return a value it returns a value back to the caller.

## Benefits of using functions: 
1. Makes your code more readable.
2. you can reuse a specific function as many times you want.
3. Functions can be used in same way as variables in all types of formulas, assignment and callculation.

## Some important notes to keep in mind:
* If we forget to include the paranthesis it will return the function object instead of function result.

* any variable defined inside of js function becomes a local variable it means that it can be used only inside the function.

* Because the local variable are only recognized inside their function then variables with the  same name can be used in different function.
