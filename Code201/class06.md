# Programming Deficulties:
One of the hardest part in programming is trying to understand the problem that occurs in your screen especially new programmer. And also talking about defficulty in programming there is also something that is called problem domain. one of the ways to to reduce the problem domain is :
 *  Using a familiar problem: a problem that can be easily understood for beginners 

**Important to note** that programming is easy if you understand the problem domain by trying to make the problem domain easier to understand by by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem. To do that affectively you need to shrink your work or cut the problem into subproblem understanding sub problems is much eaiser than taking the whole problem and try to understand it as a whole which will make your life misrable.

One of the most important note that the writer mentioned is that talking to customer who knows about the problem domain is a waste of time 

# Object Literals:
There are two important concepts in objects that we need to keep in mind is that:
 1. In Objects Variable are known as **Property**.
 2. In Objects Functions are known as **Methods**.

 **VIP** Objects represents the properties and the methods as key/value pairs.

 An easy way to create an object by using Objects Literals:
 Ex :

 var nameOne = {


     name: 'Something',

     age: 30,

     doAnything: function(){

         return anything



     }

 };

 Objects store its content as key/value pair

 **Accessing objects** is done by using the dot notation or by using square brackets for example:
 
 **Using dot notation**:

 var nameFirst = nameOne.name;

 **Using Square Brackets**:

 var nameFirst = nameOne [ 'name' ];
