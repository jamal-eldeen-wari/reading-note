# Images in CSS:
Controlling any image in CSS is done by using **Width** and **Height** properties it is like any other box.Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the 
images, and it tells the browser how much space to leave for an image so it can allow it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download.

**VIP** Best practice for images to control its dimension using CSS rather than using HTML.

# Aligning Images in CSS:
Aligning images in CSS can be achieved in two ways:
 1. The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image.
 2.  New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page. These class names are used in addition to classes that indicate the size of the image. 

Important to note that using *margins* in images is also common to ensure that the text does not touch their edge.
Also Images are also known as inline elements this means that they can flow within the surrounding text in order to center an image.

# Backgound Images in CSS:
It is a property that allows us to to place an image behind any HTML element. Background image can be used for the entire page or part of the page **By default the backgound image will repeat to fill the entire box**

To access background image we use url followed by paranthesis inside the paranthesis we put the path for that image.

# Repeating Images:
it is done by using background-repeat or backgound-attachment but the most commonly used is **background-repeat** and it has four values:
 1. repeat: The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically.
 2. repeat-x: The image is repeated **horizontally** only
 3. repeat-y: The image is repeated **vertically** only.
 4. no-repeat: The image is only shown once.
 5. fixed: The background image stays in the same position on the page.
 6. scroll: The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.

# Background Position: 
This property usually has a pair of values. The first represents the horizontal position and the second represents the vertical. We can use the background-positionproperty to specify where in the browser window the background 
image should be placed.

# Search Engine Optimization:
It is used to improve your website visibility on search engine. Is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.

In order to determine who comes first in the search results, search engines do not only look at what appears on your site. They also consider how many sites link to you. For this reason, SEO is often split into two areas: on-page techniques and off-page techniques.

### On-Page techniques:
On-page techniques are the methods you can use on your web pages to improve their rating in search engines. The main component of this is looking at keywords that people are likely to enter into a search engine if they wanted to find your site, and then including these in the text and HTML code for your site in order to help the search engines know that your site covers these topics. Search engine rely heavily on the text that is in your pages so it is important that the terms people are going to search for are in text. There are seven essential places where you want your keywords to appear.

### Off-Page techniques: 
Getting other sites to link to you is just as important as on-page techniques. Search engines help determine how to rank your site by looking at the number of other sites that link to yours. Search engines also look at the words between the opening a tag tag and closing a tag tag in the link. If the text in the link contains keywords it may be considered more relevant.
