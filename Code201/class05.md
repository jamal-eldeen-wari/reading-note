# HTML:
## Images:
In HTML we can add images to our website to make it look cool and nice. Tag img is used to represent image in our website and it is also known as an empty tag, because it does not include a closing tag at the end.
Here we will list some of the attributes that can be used with an image tag:
 1. src: One of the most important attribute for img tag, this attribute tells the browser where to find the image. For most part it will be **Relative URL** pointing to an image.
 2. alt: Provides a text description of the image which describes the image.
 3. title: it can be used to provide additional when the user hovers over it.
 4. height: Specifies for the height of the image.
 5. width:  Specifies for the width of the image.

**Important to note**: is that images take alot of time to load in comparison with the HTML code for most part you will see the HTML content will be viewed before the images.

**Three ways to place an image**:
 1. *before a paragraph*: where the paragraph starts on a new line after the image.
 2. *inside the start of a paragraph*: where the first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image.
 3. *in the middle of a paragraph*: Where the image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in.

 Placing the images in the HTML is VERY IMPORTANT because the browser shows HTML elements in one of two ways:
  * Block elements always appear on a new line.
  * Inline elements sit within a block level element and do not start on a new line.

**Align Attribute :** Is commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image.Unfortunatly, it has been removed from HTML5 and new websites should use CSS to control the alignment of images.

**Figure Tag :** This tag has been added to HTML 5 it is often used for image captioning.
**Figcaption Tag :** This tag has been added to HTML 5 in order to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image.

# CSS: 
## Color Property: 
One of the most used property in CSS, where it allows the user to specify the color of the text inside the element. We can specify colors in the CSS in three ways:
 1. RGB Value: Expresses colors in terms of how much **RED, GREEN, and BLUE** to make it up.
 2. Hex Code: Six digit codes that represnet the amount of **RED, GREEN, and BLUE**.
 3. Color Name: It has 147 predefined colors.

## Background Color: 
Similar to the color but this thing changes the background of HTML element such as body. we can also specify it same way as color:
 1. RGB Value: Expresses colors in terms of how much **RED, GREEN, and BLUE** to make it up.
 2. Hex Code: Six digit codes that represnet the amount of **RED, GREEN, and BLUE**.
 3. Color Name: It has 147 predefined colors.

**Important to note** is that every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, 
green, and blue. 

**Important to note** is that computer monitors are made up of thousands of tiny squares called **pixels**. Where every pixel is resposible to show a color of mixture of red, green, and blue.
There are alot of color picking website that can help the developers to know which colors are great with each other.Website Example: colorschemedesigner.com.

## HSL Colors: 
THese were added to CSS3 it provides a way of specifing colors using hue, saturation, and lightness.
**hue**: is the colloquial idea of color.
**saturation**: is the amount of gray in a color. Saturation is represented as a percentage. 100% is full saturation and 0% is a shade of gray.
**lightness**: is the amount of white (lightness) or black (darkness) in a color.

**hsl and hsla**: Those two where added in CSS3 as an alternative way to specify colors.They can contain hue, saturation, lightness, and alpha.

**alpha**: s expressed as a number between 0 and 1.

## Text in CSS:
There are three typeface Terminology:
1. Serif: these fonts have some extra details on the end of the main strocks of letters.
2. Sans-Serif: little bet similar but it has straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much **cleaner design**.
3. Monospace: this font has a fixed width and they are commonly used for codes because they align nicely.

Three important factors for the design of an image:
1. Weight: Can be either Light, Medium, Bold, or Black
2. Style: Can be either Normal, Italic, or Oblique
3. Stretch: can be either Condensed, Regular, or Extended

**Important to note** is that choosing a typeface it is very important because browser will usually only display it if it is installed on that user's computer. Meaning if a font is not installed in user computer then it will not display it.

Some Honorble mentions of typefaces:
* Cursive.
* Fantasy.

Text Sizes: There are three ways to represent the units of a size of a text:
 1. Pixels:  is the best way to ensure that the type appears at the size you intended the most accurate.
 2. Percentages: It is not widely used for text but it is there.
 3. Ems: Stands for electrical muscle stimulation where it allows us to change the size of text relative to the size of the text in the parent element.
