# Google Building the perfect team:

**Employee Performance Optimization:** is that firms needs to realize that analyzing and improving individual workers. Because the modern work is more and more **Team Based** and it can be proven by study from Harvard that says 
> ‘‘the time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50 percent or more’’  
And over  the last two decades and that, at many companies, more than three-quarters of an employee’s day is spent communicating with colleagues.


For software engineers they must work as a team because working together  tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. And also teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction.
Because of this Google is focussing on building the perfect team and spent over millions of dollars measuring nearly every aspect of its employees’ lives. Google’s People Operations department has scrutinized everything from how frequently particular people eat together

**Project Aristotle’s researchers**: 
The result they came up with is that No matter how researchers arranged the data, though, it was almost impossible to find patterns — or any evidence that the composition of a team made any difference. 
>‘‘We looked at 180 teams from all over the company,’’ Dubey (Project Leader) said. ‘‘We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The ‘who’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter.’’
Some groups that were ranked among Google’s most effective teams, for instance, were composed of friends who socialized outside work. Others were made up of people who were basically strangers away from the conference room. Some groups sought strong managers. Others preferred a less hierarchical structure. Most confounding of all, two teams might have nearly identical makeups, with overlapping memberships, but radically different levels of effectiveness. ‘‘At Google, we’re good at finding patterns,’’ Dubey said. ‘‘There weren’t strong patterns here.’’

Norms: Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather: One team may come to a consensus that avoiding disagreement is more valuable than debate; another team might develop a culture that encourages vigorous arguments and spurns groupthink.

After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams. But the lead research needs to find which norms mattered most.
