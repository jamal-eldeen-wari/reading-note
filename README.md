# Growth Mindset:
it is a very important topic and it is a way towards success because improving the way you think about something helps you to become more **productive**, being more **productive** means that you can achieve more things *efficiently*. Sometimes in life we are going to experince failure but if we have a growing mindset we will keep pushing forward no matter what because we want to be a better version of ourselves next day. In the words of Danny Sperry: 
> Proficiency requires time. Lots of time.

### Three Reminders that keep me in a Growth Mindset:
* Beleving that i can get better at something if i put more time and effort on it.
* Failures are steps for success.
* Is to look at your coworkers success as an inspiration and not a threat because they have worked very hard to achieve it.
