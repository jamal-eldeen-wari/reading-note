# Wireframe:
it is a practice that is used by UX (User Experience)designers, it allows them to define and plan how they are going to design a website, application or product.

So if the user knows how to reach the information that he/she wants from the wireframe (plain-drawn diagram) then your website design is perfect.

You can design your wireframe by using paper and a pin but there are tools online that can make the proccess fun and enhance your experience as a designer:

**Three key principles to make sure your wireframe is good or bad:**

1. Clarity: Must answer two basic questions to determine if your wireframe is clear or not:
    * What the user can do there?
    * Does it satisfies their needs?
2. Confidence: By making sure that your wireframe is easy to navigate and to help the user to reach his or her destination.
