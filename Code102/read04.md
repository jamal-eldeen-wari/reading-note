# Control FLow:
Is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Most important note to take through considuration is that the code will always run from top to bottom unless your computer runs on a structure that changes the control flow and that can only happen if we you conditions and loops in our code other than that the code will run normally.

** Important Note** is that the structure of your code will determine the order of execution.

# JavaScript Operators:
JavaScript is like any other programming language out there it uses operators to do specific things here are some operators:

1. Assignment Operator: It is used when we want to assign value to the left operand ex: x=y means that whatever the value of y is now the value of x. Assignment Operator is A binary operator.

2. Comparison Operator: A binary operator that compares two values whether they are equal or one of them is greater than the other and so on. It returns a boolean value such as true or false.

3. Arithmetic Operator: A binary operator, is used for math. in JavaScript we are going to use (+,-,%,/,* and **) operators.

4. Bitwise Operator: It treats the operands as a set of 32 bits rather than decimal, hexadecimal or octal.

5. Logical Operator: It returns a boolean value (either true or false) it uses (&&, || and !) operator. also to keep in mind that if these operators are used with non-Boolean values, they may return a non-Boolean value.

6. String Operator: It uses (+) operator to concatenate two strings or a string with a number.

** Differences between Binary and Unary **:

*Binary Operator* requires two operands one before the operator and the other after the operator. Whereas *Unary operator* one operand can be either before or after the operator.

Example on Binary: 5-5.

Example on Unary: number++ or ++number.
