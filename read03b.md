# CSS (Cascading Style Sheet):
It allows the developers to improve the apperance of there websites by using some of CSS tools because using only HTML the website feels boring and outdated so CSS makes the website feel alive by using different styles and themes to improve it.

CSS can be used for very basic document text styling for instance changing the font size and color of the text. CSS can be used to show some animation in your website which attracts the users.

**CSS is known as a *Rule-Based Language* ** where it allows the developer to choose which group of elements are going to be styled for instance: lets say we want to change the h1 color using CSS it can be done by only typing h1 and then open and close curly braces, inside the curly braces add the attribute to change the color.

After changing any attribute you put at the end a semicolon because CSS is a case sensative language because if you do not put semicolon then changes will not happen so keep that in mind.
