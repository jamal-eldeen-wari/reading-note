# Loops in JavaScript:
Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. 
Various loop mechanism offer different ways to determine the start and end point of loop all depends on situation sometimes there loop mechanism that can easily solve the situation easily than others.

### JavaScript Loops:
1. **For Loop**

2. **do....while Loop Statement**

3. **While Statement**

4. **Labled Statement**

5. **Break**

6. **Continue**

7. **For..in Statement**

8. **For..of Statement**

## For Loop Statement:
It repeats until a specific condition is false but as long as that condition returns true it will continue to loop. **For Loop is Known as Limited Number of Repeats**
### **For Loop Syntax**:
**for([Starting Point]; [Condition]; [Increment/ Decrement]){**

  *Here Are Some Code*

**}**

## for loop workflow:
1. it starts at starting point -> a variable that is assign to value.

2. then it checks the condition if that starting point meets the condition (Meaning the condition is true) then execute the statement below otherwise exit the loop.

3. Now if the statement is executed then the value of the starting point is incremented or decremented then that new starting point value is checked by condition if true execute the statement again otherwise exit the loop.

## While Loop: 
It is known as Unlimited Number of Repeats. It executes the statement as long as the condition is true.If the condition of while loop becomes false then it exit the loop and continues on the other statement after the while loop.

### **While Loop Syntax:**
**while (Condition){**

  **Statement;**

**}**

### While Loop Workflow:
1. Condition is checked if the condition is true it will execute the statement.

2. After the first loop it checks the condition if false it exit the loop.

## Three Important Notes About Loops:
1. In For Loop and While Loop if we have multiple statement inside of them we need to include **curly braces ({....})**.

2. In While Loop we need to be careful of the infinite loop.

3. **Comma Operator**: evaluates both of its operands and returns the value of the last operand, it is primarly used for the For Loop and specificaly for 2D array.
