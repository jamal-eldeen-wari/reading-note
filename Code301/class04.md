# Forms:
It is similar to the HTML where the form elements such as input tag, textarea tag and select tag typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().

 form has the default HTML form behavior of browsing to a new page when the user submits the form. If you want this behavior in React, it just works. But in most cases, it’s convenient to have a JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form and has access to the data that the user entered into the form.

With a controlled component, the input’s value is always driven by the React state. While this means you have to type a bit more code, you can now pass the value to other UI elements too, or reset it from other event handlers.


# The Conditional (Ternary) Operator:

It is similar to if condition but it can be done in one line it saves alot of time while coding rather than using if condition

X===y? console.log(true): console.log(false);
